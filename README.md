# Data Generator Script
### Description
This Python script is designed to simulate data collection similar to a survey. It generates dictionaries with random values based on user inputs and saves the results to a CSV file. The script then converts the CSV file to Excel (.xlsx) format. Although initially created for simulating survey data, it can be adapted for various other data generation needs.
